# Redis_Small_App

This is a simple training project to practice integrating and using Redis as a database in a Node.js application. The project demonstrates how to connect to a Redis server, perform basic operations such as setting and retrieving values, and use Redis for caching and fast data retrieval.

## Features

- Connects to a Redis database from a Node.js app.
- Stores and retrieves key-value pairs.
- Demonstrates basic Redis commands and usage.
- Example for using Redis as a cache layer to improve performance.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Make sure you have Redis installed and running locally.
4. Run the app with `node index.js` (or the main file).

## Why Redis?

Redis is an in-memory key-value store that is commonly used for caching, session management, and fast data operations. This project serves as a practical introduction to these concepts.
